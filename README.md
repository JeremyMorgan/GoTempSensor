# Go Temp Sensor!

Temperature reading and storage with a Raspberry Pi and Go 

This is the code from a [Live stream I did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvWuFIvBRbY) where we hand built a temperature reading storage system for fun. 

Readsensor.go reads the code from the sensor and sends it out through a POST

Storage.go is for the service that takes the POST and stores the data in sqllite database. 

This will be a work in progress, we'll build on it in future streams.
